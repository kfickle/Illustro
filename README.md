# Wordpress Theme: Illustro 
<h2> Project Overview </h2>
<p>Illustro is a responsive, minimalistic wp theme based on Bootstrap-3.3.7. Features include page and post templates, advanced custom fields and options, hero images, a jumbotron area, sidebars and widget areas, and more. </p>

<p><strong>BEFORE YOU CONTINUE:</strong> This theme was created as a student project and will not be receiving routine updates. I'd love it if you used my Illustro code to learn more about WordPress theming, but I would not recommend this theme for published websites. Some advice? Content Management Systems are database-driven, so safeguard your data and user-base by choosing a WordPress theme that receives frequent security updates. There are some excellent free options over on the official <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/" target="_blank"//haha just kidding this doesn't work in markdown (┛ಠ_ಠ)┛彡┻━┻>WordPress Theme Directory</a>.</p>

  <h2>Knowledgebase</h2>

  <p>While it isn't required that you know anything about web development before you start working with Content Management Systems (like WordPress) it's helpful to have some base-level knowledge before you start building a custom theme.</p>
