BEFORE YOU USE THIS THEME: Please be aware that this theme was created as a student project, and will, therefore, not be receiving routine updates. Illustro would be a great starting point for student's who want to learn more about WordPress theming, but I would not recommend this project for professional use. Some advice? Content Management Systems are database-driven, so you want to safeguard your databases as much as possible. When in doubt, always go with a WordPress theme that receives frequent security updates.
