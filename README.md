<h3>Knowledgebase</h3>

While it isn't required that you know anything about web development before you start working with Content Management Systems (like WordPress) it's helpful to have some base-level knowledge before jumping into working with child-theming.

<strong>BEFORE YOU CONTINUE:</strong> This child-theme was created as a student project and will not be receiving routine updates. I'd love it if you used my Illustro code to learn more about WordPress theming, but I would not recommend this project actual use. Some advice? Content Management Systems are database-driven, so safeguard your website by using a WordPress theme that receives frequent security updates. There are some excellent free options over on the official <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/" target="_blank">WordPress Theme Directory</a>.
