BEFORE YOU CONTINUE: This child-theme was created as a student project and will not be receiving routine updates. I'd love it if you used my Illustro code to learn more about WordPress theming, but I would not recommend this project actual use. Some advice? Content Management Systems are database-driven, so safeguard your website by using a WordPress theme that receives frequent security updates. There are some excellent free options over on the official <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/" target="_blank">WordPress Theme Directory</a>.
